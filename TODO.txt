TODO
- try/catch in lambda funcs
- refactor react app for consistency once it's functional
- tests
- getrecord pagination
- auth password reset && signup(?)
- ui layout and styling
- Move to correct DNS
- IaC for ACM, Cloudfront and S3

# JSON Update
- Primary Key will be a composite value of Account__TicketID, sort key will be Direction
- /getrecord returns all records - will need to paginate: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.Pagination.html
    - rename to be more meaningful
    - partition key has to be known to perform the query, so stick with this approach
        - return all records to client and do filtering on client side - record size limit is 1MB
